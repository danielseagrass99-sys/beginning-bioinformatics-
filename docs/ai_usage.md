# AI Use Log Rosalind #3
- Tool/model & version: Chat GPT 5
- What I asked for: explain this loop code to me a, b = 100, 200 total = 0 for i in range(a, b + 1): # b+1 so b is included if i % 2 == 1: total += i print(total)
- Snippet of prompt(s): for i in range(a, b + 1):   # b+1 so b is included
range(a, b + 1) generates numbers starting at a and ending at b.

In Python, range stops just before the second number, so we use b + 1 to make sure b is included.

So here, i will take on every number from 100, 101, 102, â€¦ , 200.
